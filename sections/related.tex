\section{Summary}

Since this thesis focuses on performance on low-end hardware the other effects will not be considered even if scattering has been implemented with \gls{vct} in \cite{cedecpres}. As stated earlier creating soft shadows can be a quite difficult problem, however with \gls{vct} it is the opposite and the softer the shadow the more efficient it is.
